# pwa-share-target-data-revealer

If you have a PWA installed on android you can register it as a [share target](https://web.dev/web-share-target/). For debugging purposes this PWA allows you to see exactly what type of data will be transferred through the share intent.

Add this site to your homescreen from android chrome and then from any android app share to this PWA to reveal the data being transferred.
